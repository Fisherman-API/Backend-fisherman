They have one continuous dorsal fin that runs from the nape of their neck to their caudal peduncle (where the body meets the tail) and a small tail fin.

An optional sector (catch share) program can be used for cod and other groundfish species. 
The sector program allows fishermen to form harvesting cooperatives and work together to decide when, where, and how they harvest fish.'),

Fishing season is generally year-round, but individual commercial shark fisheries close when the quota is reached.'),

Managers divide the catch limit into four area-specific limits. When an area-specific limit is reached, the directed fishery in that area is prohibited and only incidental catches of herring are allowed.
A limited access permit program limits the number of vessels that can participate in the directed fishery for herring. Vessels that do not qualify for a limited access permit can be issued an open access permit, allowing them to harvest a small amount of herring (6,600 pounds) per day or per trip.
Limits on the amount of herring a vessel can possess in one day or on one trip, depending on the type of permit.'),

All Atlantic salmon caught incidentally in other fisheries must be released in a manner that ensures maximum probability of survival. This protects Atlantic salmon in U.S. marine waters and complements management in state-managed riverine and coastal waters.'),
