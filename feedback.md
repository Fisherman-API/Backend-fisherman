# Fisherman API

Great job this week friends -- I know it was not quite what you initially envisioned but I still think you made a really cool, helpful app for fisherman -- I also think you could continue to build on it after graduation which would be a fun project. Here are some general notes / feedback:

- make sure you remove file with the extra code in it -- i know its tempting to keep things like that around "in case you need them" but remember you have git for that!
- a good approach for "soft deletes" is to add a date time column in your database called "deleted_at" add the date the row was soft deleted
- don't forget to add some more info to the README -- this is the main home page for recruiters looking at your project -- give them some info on what you did and why
- i added some notes on making one of your routes more RESTful
